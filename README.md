C++ PROGRAM STRUCTURE AND DATA TYPES

This is a basic C++ project to study and implement the structure of a C++ program and understand different **data types** used in C++.
## 🎯 Objective
- Learn the basic structure of a C++ program
- Understand how to declare and use different **data types**
- Print the size of each data type using `sizeof` operator

## 🛠️ C++ Program Structure Includes:
- `#include <iostream>` – for input/output
- `main()` function – the starting point of any C++ program
- Statements inside `{}` (curly braces)
- Use of semicolons `;` to end statements

## 🧠 Common Data Types in C++
| Data Type | Example | Description            |
|-----------|---------|------------------------|
| `int`     | 10      | Integer                |
| `float`   | 3.14f   | Floating point number  |
| `double`  | 3.14159 | Double precision float |
| `char`    | 'A'     | Single character       |
| `bool`    | true    | Boolean value          |
